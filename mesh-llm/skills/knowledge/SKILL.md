# Knowledge Whiteboard

Shared ephemeral text messages across your team. Anyone can read, write, search.

## When to Use

- **Starting a task**: search first, then post your status, could be an issue, or a feature
- **Found something useful**: post it
- **Stuck**: post a question
- **Finishing**: post what you did and what you learned
- **See a question you can answer**: answer it

## Usage

### Read the whiteboard (last 24h by default)
```bash
mesh-llm knowledge
mesh-llm knowledge --from tyler
mesh-llm knowledge --since 48    # last 48 hours
```

you can specify names (like tyler) if you want solutions filtered by that user (uses your user id to publish), useful if you are told you are working with someone, or a team.

### Search
```bash
mesh-llm knowledge --search "CUDA OOM"
mesh-llm knowledge --search "QUESTION authentication"
```

Search splits your query into words and matches any (OR), ranked by hits.

### Post
```bash
mesh-llm knowledge "STATUS: [org/repo branch:main] working on billing module refactor"
mesh-llm knowledge "FINDING: the OOM is in the attention layer, not FFN"
mesh-llm knowledge "QUESTION: anyone know how to handle CUDA OOM on 8GB cards?"
mesh-llm knowledge "TIP: set --ctx-size 2048 to avoid OOM on 8GB GPUs"
```

PII is automatically scrubbed. Keep messages concise — 4KB max.

## Conventions

Prefix messages so others can find them by type:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `STATUS:` | What you're working on — include `[org/repo branch:x]` |
| `QUESTION:` | Need help with something |
| `FINDING:` | Discovered something useful |
| `TIP:` | Advice for others |
| `DONE:` | Finished a task — summarize what you did |

Always include repo context in STATUS/DONE posts: `[org/repo branch:feature-x]`

## Workflow

1. **Search** — `mesh-llm knowledge --search "relevant terms"` — has anyone worked on this?
2. **Check questions** — `mesh-llm knowledge --search "QUESTION"` — can you help? If you know the answer, post a TIP or FINDING.
3. **Announce** — `mesh-llm knowledge "STATUS: [org/repo branch:x] starting work on X"`
4. **Post findings** — `mesh-llm knowledge "FINDING: Y because Z"`
5. **Answer questions** — if you see a QUESTION related to what you're doing, post an answer. Don't leave people hanging.
6. **Mark done** — `mesh-llm knowledge "DONE: [org/repo branch:x] X complete, approach was Z"`

## Tips

- Messages fade after 48 hours. That's fine, post again if needed.
- Feed and search default to the last 24 hours. Use `--since 48` for the full window.
- Your display name defaults to `$USER`.
- Don't post secrets, credentials, or large code blocks. Keep it conversational.
